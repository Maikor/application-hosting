We're up at [NANOG 67](https://www.nanog.org/meetings/NANOG67/home) in Chicago, IL, next week!

Over the course of more than 2 decades, the **N**orth **A**merican **N**etwork **O**perators' **G**roup ([NANOG](https://www.nanog.org)) has been at the epicenter of the net-ops transformation.    
This unique congregation of vendors, service-provider, Data-Center and Enterprise SMEs and network engineers provides a perfect opportunity to showcase some of the new enhancements in IOS-XR.   


As always, there is a fair bit of Cisco participation, with content focused on Streaming Telemetry, connectivity evaluation and remediation techniqus using Linux applications.
Of course, if you're looking to talk about IOS-XR and other Cisco solutions for the Web, Data Center and Service Provider domain, you'll find a lot of us roaming about!
