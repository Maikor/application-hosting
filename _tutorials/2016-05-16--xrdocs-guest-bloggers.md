## Quick Recap on types of Users @xrdocs:


>
There are 2 types of users on @xrdocs
>
*   **Owners/contributors** of the corresponding github repos (app-hosting, telemetry etc.). The documents created by these users on prose.io directly get committed to the github repos (hence the website), when saved.
*   **Guest Bloggers**: Do NOT have write access to repositories. All their documents created on prose.io appear as pull requests on github, and are subject to a peer review by the owners/contributors before merging with the website.  

TMEs in the Web Solutions group at Cisco are by default the owners of the internal github repositories that host the XR documentation.
