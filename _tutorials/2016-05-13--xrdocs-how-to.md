Welcome to @xrdocs!

This tutorial is meant to get a new blogger/technical-writer, unfamiliar with @xrdocs, up and running in minutes.

Cisco IOS-XR 6.0+ brings with it some key operational enhancements in the domains of:
  1. Monitoring (Streaming Telemetry)
  2. Automation (APIs based on YANG models)
  3. iPXE and ZTP (automated provisioning through iPXE and shell scripts)
  4. Software management ( RPM based package management) and 
  5. Application hosting (Direct linux access to host applications onbox as processes/containers).
  
However, these enhancements require the right tools to aid their consumption. 
In our minds, at a macro level we can classify the tools into two types:
  1. **User end tools/applications**:  eg. YDK-py, Streaming Telemetry plugins for ELK/Prometheus/SignalFX, support for Config-management tools like Ansible, Puppet and Chef, YUM repositories for WRL7 apps etc.
  2. **Documentation**: Regular Blogs, Step-by-step tutorials and detailed technical documents have to accompany tools. There is probably nothing more infuriating than a badly documented piece of code/tool/feature.
  
  
  
  **@xrdocs** has been designed to address these documentation concerns. The choice was simple, we needed a platform to quickly churn out relevant documentation and make sure it remains up-to-date with all the changes coming up in IOS-XR.
