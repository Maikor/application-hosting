## What you need to know to begin using IOS XR 64-bit

Before you begin, it is essential that you are familiar with the IOS XR 64-bit Linux Shell.

The 64-bit IOS XR uses a hypervisor to offer you the provision of creating your own build environment, or spinning up your own Linux Container (LXC) for hosting applications. XR uses a Windriver Yocto distribution and is designed to work well with embedded systems.

When you start using XR, you are offered with three distinct options for hosting applications:

1. Building your own environment natively in the control plane of XR.
2. Spinning up your own container on the XR.
3. Using a docker.
